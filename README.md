An application that allows you to create a video playlist of Youtube music videos.


> Explanations of the technologies used

I created a CRUD app using React front-end and Express Back-end. 

> Approach taken

I started off by figureing out what I needed for a the SQL Table. After that created the migration and seed files so i could make the back-end table. Then i decided to start on the express back-end. I made the files needed which were the Db, Model, Controller, and Routes. Then i Started on the React app after.

> Unsolved problems

- The Delete and Add Song button work but will display an error as if it   doesnt. One you refresh the page you'll she that in works.
- The Edit button does work yet. I am still working on that.
- The CSS is a bit messed up for some reason. I am woring on that also.
